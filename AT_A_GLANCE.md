## 🎓 YOUR TALKING POINTS (Memorize!)

### **30 Second Version:**
"I built an automated question paper generation system using semantic embeddings. It uses two pre-trained models: SBERT for understanding topic-content relationships and Tesseract OCR for document processing. The system combines AI-powered semantic matching with custom business logic based on Bloom's taxonomy. It works completely offline, generates 100-question papers in 5 seconds, and requires no GPU."

### **2 Minute Version:**
"My system automates question paper generation for educational institutions. It uses a pragmatic hybrid approach combining pre-trained models with domain-specific logic.

First, users upload a syllabus PDF. The system extracts topics using Tesseract OCR for scanned documents or PyMuPDF for native PDFs.

Next, they upload a textbook PDF, which I chunk into manageable segments.

The key innovation is semantic mapping: I use SBERT, a pre-trained neural network, to convert both topics and chunks into 384-dimensional semantic vectors. Cosine similarity then finds the best-matching chunks for each topic.

For question generation, I created Bloom's taxonomy templates. The system selects questions matching the specified cognitive level, marks, and module, then fills templates with relevant content from the chunks.

This produces diverse, relevant questions aligned with educational standards. No GPU needed, works offline, generates papers in seconds. I chose pre-trained models instead of training from scratch because it's faster, more reliable, and follows industry best practices."

## ✅ PRE-VIVA CONFIDENCE CHECK

**Can you answer these?**

1. "What are the two pre-trained models you used?"
   - SBERT and Tesseract ✓

2. "Why didn't you train models yourself?"
   - Would need millions of samples and weeks of GPU time ✓

3. "How does semantic matching work?"
   - SBERT encodes to vectors → cosine similarity → top-K selection ✓

4. "Is this production-ready?"
   - Yes. Works offline, fast, no GPU, handles real PDFs ✓

5. "What makes your project special?"
   - System integration: complete pipeline from PDF to paper ✓

**If you can answer these, you're ready!**

## 📖 ONE LAST THING

**The Most Important Insight:**

Your project isn't just about using SBERT and Tesseract. Your real contribution is:

**Building a complete system that**
- **Understands meaning** (semantic matching)
- **Handles diversity** (native + scanned PDFs)
- **Enforces standards** (Bloom's taxonomy)
- **Scales efficiently** (no GPU needed)
- **Works reliably** (offline, no APIs)
- **Solves real problems** (educators' pain point)

This is exactly what industry needs and what examiners want to see.

**Go crush that viva! 🎓**

## 📞 EMERGENCY ANSWERS

**If completely stuck:**

Q: "Explain your models"
A: "I used Sentence-Transformers for semantic understanding and Tesseract for document processing. Both pre-trained. This hybrid approach gives me AI intelligence with rule-based control."

Q: "Why should I believe this works?"
A: "I can show you the demo. Here's performance data. These are proven production models."

Q: "What's the hardest part?"
A: "Ensuring semantic relevance. I validate with similarity scores, manual checks, and output validation."

Q: "Future work?"
A: "Better question diversity, multi-language support, automated answer keys, LLM integration."
